Restart an experiment
*************************

You might want to restart the **same experiment** but with **new values** once an experiment is finished.

The trick is to **create a new experiment with the same tag** as the old experiment. The **clone** button on the archived experiment will do it for you. A new experiment will be created with the same tag as the old experiment. This way when you will publish your new experiment, your mobile application will automatically pull variation values from the new experiment. To sum up:

1. Archive your old experiment by clicking on "Use Variation X"
2. Clone the old experiment --> A new experiment will be created with the same tag as the old experiment
3. Set values for the new experiment
4. Start your new experiment --> You mobile app will automatically show variations from the new experiment
